        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup 
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web 
            browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as 
            Cascading Style Sheets 
            (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

            <li> <b>History.</b> In 1980, physicist 
            Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped
             ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. 
             In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based 
             hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the 
             browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee 
             and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a 
             joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted
              by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed 
              "some of the many areas in 
            which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</li>

       <li><b>HTTP.</b>
        Main article: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted
         from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
          However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, 
         in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle 
         each document it receives, other information is transmitted along 
         with the document. This meta data usually includes the MIME type
          (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see Character encoding in HTML).
        In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is 
        initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to 
        be well-formed XML; syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with
         the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.
        The W3C recommendations state that XHTML 1.0 documents that
         follow guidelines set forth in the recommendation's Appendix 
         C may be labeled with either MIME Type.XHTML 1.1 also 
         states that XHTML 1.1 documents should be labeled with 
         either MIME type.</li>
